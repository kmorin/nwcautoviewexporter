nwcautoviewexporter
===================

auto create nwc files on project save

## Get Started

1. Make sure you have Revit 2014 installed.
2. Make Sure you have a working Navisworks Exporter revit plugin for 2014
3. Download and run the installer [here](https://github.com/kmorin/nwcautoviewexporter/blob/master/NWCViewExporterInstaller.msi?raw=true)

## Build from source

1. You must have the proper folder structure setup before the project will compile correctly. Revit depends too much on the proper .bundle structure.
